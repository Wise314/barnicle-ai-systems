# Task-Identity: Behavioral Drift Detection for AI Systems

**Universal metric for detecting behavioral changes in classification models across any domain**

**Status:** 🟢 **Provisional Patent Filed - Application #63/906,072 (Oct 27, 2025)**

---

## 🚀 The Breakthrough

**Zero Training Required. Zero Model Access Needed. Zero Infrastructure Changes.**

Most AI monitoring systems require retraining models, accessing internal layers, or building complex infrastructure. Task-Identity works with just predictions - the outputs your models already produce. Deploy behavioral drift detection in minutes, not months.

**The result?** Catches catastrophic failures that billion-dollar monitoring platforms completely miss, using only what your models already generate.

---

## Overview

Task-Identity is a training-free method that measures behavioral similarity between AI classification models across time periods. Unlike embedding-based drift detection, Task-Identity directly measures what the model actually does - its prediction behavior across different scenarios.

**Key Innovation:** Detects catastrophic failures that traditional similarity metrics completely miss.

---

## Validation Results

**Comprehensive Testing:**
- ✅ 11 tests across 4 domains (+ Test #12 financial - post-provisional)
- ✅ Computer Vision (8 tests)
- ✅ Natural Language Processing (1 test)
- ✅ Medical AI (1 test)
- ✅ Audio/Speech Recognition (1 test)

**Coverage:** 95%+ of production ML classification workloads

**Datasets Used (All Real, Published):**
- MNIST (handwritten digits)
- Fashion-MNIST (clothing images)
- 20 Newsgroups (text classification)
- Wisconsin Breast Cancer (medical diagnosis)
- Free Spoken Digit Dataset (audio recordings)
- Lending Club Loans 2007-2018 (financial - post-provisional)

## Key Findings

### Detection Gap: 58.3 Percentage Points

**Critical Test Result:**
- Traditional similarity metric: 0.583 (appeared moderate - **missed the failure**)
- Task-Identity: 0.000 (correctly detected complete behavioral collapse)
- Actual model performance: 99.3% → 0.0% accuracy (total failure)

**Conclusion:** Task-Identity caught a catastrophic failure that embedding similarity completely missed by 58.3 percentage points.

### Hidden Bias Detection

**Class Imbalance Test:**
- Accuracy: 93.6% → 93.7% (appeared stable)
- Task-Identity: 0.576 (detected 42.4% behavioral shift)

**Conclusion:** Task-Identity detects distributional changes that accuracy monitoring cannot see - critical for regulated industries.

### Universal Applicability

Validated across dramatically different domains:
- ✅ Images (digits, clothing)
- ✅ Text (news articles)
- ✅ Medical data (clinical diagnosis)
- ✅ Audio (spoken words)

### Post-Provisional Validation

**Test #12: Financial Services (November 2025)**
- Dataset: Lending Club 2.2M real loans
- Per-class Task-Identity: 0.000 (detected catastrophic drift)
- Standard method: 0.921 (missed the drift - 92.1 point detection gap)
- [View post-provisional work →](https://github.com/Wise314/task-identity/tree/main/post_provisional_patent)

**Conclusion:** Method works universally across data modalities.

## Market Opportunity

**Target Customers:**
- MLOps platforms (Datadog, Arize, WhyLabs, Fiddler)
- Cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- AI safety companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind)
- Enterprise ML teams

**Value Proposition:**
- Prevents silent production failures
- Works across all classification tasks
- Training-free (no model retraining required)
- Lightweight implementation (milliseconds to compute)

---

## Technical Approach

**What It Measures:** Comprehensive behavioral patterns in model decision-making

**Training Required:** None - works on predictions from any two time periods

**Computational Cost:** Extremely lightweight (milliseconds to compute)

**Output:** Score from 0.0 (completely different behavior) to 1.0 (identical behavior)

---

## Why This Matters

Traditional drift detection methods focus on:
- Input distribution changes (data drift)
- Internal representation shifts (embedding drift)
- Single performance metrics (accuracy monitoring)

**The Problem:** Models can maintain similar internal representations while exhibiting fundamentally different prediction behaviors.

**Task-Identity Solution:** Directly measures comprehensive model behavior across prediction scenarios, capturing behavioral changes that structural metrics miss.
