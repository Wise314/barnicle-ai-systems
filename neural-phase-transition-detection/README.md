# Neural Phase Transition Detection: Architecture Viability Prediction

**Predict whether any neural network architecture will succeed or fail—after just one training epoch**

**3 Datasets | 22 Architectures | 95% Accuracy | One Epoch Required**

**Status:** 🟢 **Provisional Patent Filed - Application #63/931,603 (December 5, 2025)**

## 🚀 The Breakthrough

**One Epoch. Binary Decision. 95% Accuracy.**

A universal method that predicts whether any neural network architecture will form coherent behavioral identity or fail completely—using only first-epoch training data. Same method works across CNNs, MLPs, grayscale images, and RGB images.

**The result?** Stop wasting 80-95% of compute on architectures doomed from the start.

---

## Overview

Neural Phase Transition Detection is the first method proven to predict architecture viability after a single training epoch. Unlike approaches requiring full training runs to evaluate candidates, this method provides binary go/no-go decisions in minutes instead of days.

**Key Innovation:** Identifies whether architectures are capable of forming coherent behavioral identity—not just how fast they'll train, but whether they'll work at all.

## What This Predicts

### Architecture Viability
- **Will this architecture work?** Binary prediction after one epoch
- **Should we continue training?** Go/no-go decision in minutes
- **Which candidates to eliminate?** Filter out 80-95% of non-viable architectures immediately

### Validated Capabilities
- ✅ Grayscale images (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST)
- ✅ RGB images (CIFAR-10)
- ✅ CNN architectures (2-5 layers)
- ✅ MLP architectures (various depths)
- ✅ Predicts both success AND failure

## The $2M+ Problem

### Current State of Architecture Search

**Neural Architecture Search:** Test 100+ candidates × 50 epochs = weeks of compute
**Hyperparameter Optimization:** Grid search across thousands of configurations
**Transfer Learning Validation:** Fine-tune dozens of pre-trained models to find winners
**Research Experiments:** Waste GPU-months on architectures that never converge

**The Gap:** No early termination. No viability prediction. Burn compute to find out.

### Our Solution

- **One epoch** to predict viability (not 50)
- **Binary decision** (will work vs. won't work)
- **Universal method** (CNNs, MLPs, any image type)
- **95% accuracy** on diverse architectures
- **Minutes instead of days** per candidate

## Relationship to Other Patents

| Patent | Focus | Relationship |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| #2 (Identity Formation) | How FAST will it train? | Complementary |
| **#7 (This Patent)** | **Will it WORK at all?** | **Novel question** |

This patent answers a fundamentally different question than training speed prediction. Architecture viability is binary (works/doesn't work), not continuous (fast/slow).
