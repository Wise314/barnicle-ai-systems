### Task-Identity: Behavioral Drift Detection for AI Systems

**Status:** 🟢 **Provisional Patent Filed (October 2025)**  
**Availability:** Open for exclusive or non-exclusive licensing now

**What it does:** Detects catastrophic AI model failures that existing drift monitors completely miss.

**The Problem It Solves:**  
In validated testing, a production model collapsed from 99.3% accuracy to 0.0% (total failure). Traditional embedding-based drift detection reported a score of 0.583 ("moderate, looks stable"). Task-Identity scored 0.000 and immediately flagged the catastrophic failure.

**Detection Gap:** 58.3 percentage points better than state-of-the-art drift monitoring.

**Validation:**
- 11 comprehensive tests across 4 domains (+ Test #12 financial services - post-provisional)
- Computer Vision, NLP, Medical AI, Audio/Speech
- 95%+ coverage of production ML classification workloads
- [View complete validation →](./task-identity/)

**Commercial Applications:**
- Production ML monitoring (prevents silent failures)
- Autonomous vehicle safety systems
- Medical AI quality control
- Content moderation systems
- Voice assistant reliability

**Licensing:** Exclusive or non-exclusive licenses available immediately.
